                        Hi, my name is Justin!  I currently study mechatronics engineering (a combination of
                        software, mechanical, and electrical engineering) at the University of Waterloo. I'm 
                        a software developer with an interest in data infrastructure, distributed systems,
                        and artificial intelligence.  
                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        This fall, I'll be interning at Google on the Ads team (Waterloo, ON).  Most recently,
                        I interned on the backend team at Imply (San Mateo, CA) where I worked on Apache
                        Druid, an open-source OLAP datastore, and integrated Kafka data streams
                        with the company's Druid cluster management system.  Previously, I've interned at
                        Toast (Boston, MA) and Lytx (Markham, ON).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Feel free to read more about me and/or reach out via email or LinkedIn.
                    </p>
